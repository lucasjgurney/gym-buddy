#Gym Buddy Back End API
This API serves all of the data and images for the Gym Buddy program.

#Installation/Set up guide
1. Download the latest versions of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) for your relevant operating system.
2. Download these files by cloning (recommended) or downloading the zip and extracting the contents.
3. Copy the `config-example.js` file. Rename this copy `config.js` and give change all values within the file as appropriate.
4. Run the `mongod` command from the terminal to start Mongo.
5. Navigate to the directory where Gym Buddy is stored on your system in the terminal. Install dependencies with `npm install` and then run the command `node server.js`.
6. The API should now be up and running. Install the UI if you need an interface.
